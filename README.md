This is **Pixel Clash!**

It's a 2D monster slaying action game created using Python and the Pygame library, with a big focus on Object-Oriented Programing and classes. You play as a warrior battling various monsters. The objective is to survive the never-ending clash, defeat as many enemies as possible, and achieve the highest score.

**Controls:**

* Left and right arrow keys: Move left and right respectively
* Spacebar: Jump
* Hold right shift: Attack (when standing still)

**Gameplay:**

You start from the main menu, and can press the **Start** button with the mouse to begin. Once playing, you must avoid enemy attacks by running and jumping, and strike them at the same time. You must be standing still and facing the enemies to actually slay them as you attack. If your health reaches zero and you are defeated, you get to try again by pressing the **Try Again** button.
